Once upon a time, there is a family of 3 living in a wood. One day, the parents left the house for supplies, leaving the little girl in the house, and a young thief came...

The door was open, just a little, where the thief had slipped in, and wisps of nighttime mist slithered and twined into the house through the open door.

The thief looted here and there, without to0 much of a ruckus, taking a variety of valuables. He was displeased with this house's galmour, until he found the vault in the study. He stood there drooling over the riches he had found: gold and cash. He looked up and saw the little girl holding a blanket in her left hand, with her head tilted to a side curiously. She asked the theif, "Is this a dream?" To which his reply was, "Yes, for me and you." He crept past her, holding eye contact, until he was gone with his riches into the night.
