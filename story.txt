Once upon a time, there is a family of 3 living in a wood. One day, the parents left the house for supplies, leaving the little girl in the house, and a young thief came...

The door was open, just a little, where the thief had slipped in, and wisps of nighttime mist slithered and twined into the house through the open door.
